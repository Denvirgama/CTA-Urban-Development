# Analysis of Crime Rates, CTA Access, and Housing Prices in Chicago

## Introduction

### The Influence of Crime Rates and Public Transportation on Housing Prices in Chicago

Housing prices in urban settings are shaped by numerous factors, with crime rates and access to public transportation being among the most impactful. Understanding the relationship between these elements is crucial for a range of stakeholders, including policymakers, urban planners, real estate investors, and residents. This report focuses on Chicago, a city renowned for its diverse neighborhoods, comprehensive public transit system managed by the Chicago Transit Authority (CTA), and varying crime rates.

### Importance of This Analysis

1. **Public Safety and Livability**:
   - **Crime Rates**: Elevated crime rates can significantly diminish housing prices as safety is a primary concern for residents and potential homebuyers. High crime levels can deter investment, lower property values, and degrade the overall quality of life in affected areas.
   - **Public Transit**: Efficient and accessible public transportation enhances neighborhood attractiveness by providing convenient access to employment, education, and essential services. Proximity to CTA stations is often associated with higher housing prices due to increased accessibility.

2. **Urban Planning and Development**:
   - Policymakers and urban planners can use insights from this analysis to prioritize investments in public safety and transit infrastructure. Targeted improvements in high-crime or underserved neighborhoods can stimulate economic development and improve living conditions.

3. **Real Estate Investment**:
   - Real estate investors utilize data on crime and transportation to make informed decisions regarding property transactions. Areas with low crime rates and good transit access are typically more desirable, commanding higher prices.

4. **Community Well-being**:
   - For residents, understanding the influence of crime and transit access on housing prices can guide decisions about where to live and foster community advocacy for enhanced policing, safety initiatives, and transportation services.

### Scope of the Analysis

This report examines the interplay between crime rates, CTA access, and housing prices in Chicago. We will:
1. **Fetch and preprocess crime data** to analyze crime patterns across different neighborhoods.
2. **Examine census data** to capture demographic and economic factors that influence housing prices.
3. **Investigate housing data** to identify trends in property values.
4. **Integrate public transit data** from the CTA to evaluate the impact of transit proximity on housing prices.

Through this comprehensive approach, we aim to identify key patterns and correlations that can inform urban planning and investment strategies, contributing to a safer, more accessible, and economically vibrant Chicago.
